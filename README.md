### Purpose of this Repo:
- Enrolled in the Cyber Security Engineering Program through Code Feoolws working towards the following certifications: 
    - Comptia ITF+
    - Comptia Network+
    - Comptia Security+
- During the process we are presentd with Ops Challenges.
- At the time this repo was created I was enrolled in the 201 Intro to Computer Operations Course.
- This repo houses all the scripts for the Ops Challenges we were assigned during the course.

### Purpose of my Learning:
- I have enrolled in this program to develop new skills and break away from my previous tech role as a Manager QA Software Engineer. 
- Breaking down peoples code and finding bugs in the system has been enjoyable for me but I am seeking more fullfilment in my career future. 
- In addition to QA I have a background in electrical troubleshooting and love to solve complex problems.
- I am hoping to combine my new skills with my old ones to break into the Cyber Security field possibly work my way into DevOps.

### Fundemental Concepts Learned in Ops 201:
- Creating, accessing and utilizing Virtual Machines.
    - Servers and PC systems
    - Running locally an a HyperVisor
    - Spinning up VMs on the Cloud with AWS EC2 and Lightsail
    - Virtualizing a router
- Various System Backups including:
    - Hypervisor Snapshots
    - .ova file backups
- Using CLI and scripting
    - Bash
    - Command Prompt
    - Powershell
- Utilizing an Issue Tracking System
- Working with different OSs and Upgrading an OS
    - Ubuntu Linux
    - Windows 7, 10, 11
- Comptia Troubleshooting techniques
- Windows Security Center and Windows Defender Feaatures
- Imaging, Backup and Recovery tools
- Data Restoration
- Malware remediation tools

## Favorite Challenges from this course:
- I really enjoyed all ops-challenges relating to Powershell. I knew it was powerful and based on the .Net framework but I did not know it would be so user friendly. Using the Powershell ISE for scripting made creating these scripts smooth. I really appreciate the documentation Microsoft has for this as well, it is some of the most complete and eaasy to follow documentation I have seen.

### How can these scripts be utilized to work for your company?:
- Lets just look at [Ops Challenge 8](https://github.com/PrutchD/ops-201d8-code-challenges/blob/main/ops_challenge_class_08.bat) This simple .bat file copies a users files to a separate drive to create a complete backup. This can be set up to run using windows Task Scheduler to run at the end of each work day. Each day it will backup the files automatically overwriting previous data creating an accurate up to date backup in case something goes wrong with their system and it needs to be wiped all their files can be restored.

### Script Improvement:
- One of the first things I would like to do when time allows is to refactor all my scripts utilizing functions. 
    - I would have them accept parameters instead of utilizing variabl names in order to be reuseable across other systems and scripts.

### Constant Improvement:
- Writing scripts takes practice to develop skill.
- Through constant practice I hope to develop:
    - Writing cleaner more efficient code
    - Writing more reusable code
